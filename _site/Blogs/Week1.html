<h2 id="week-1-documentation">Week 1 Documentation</h2>
<p>Week 1 was mainly a working week, however I tweaked many CSS and designs into the week. Iâ€™ll be going over the CSS tweaks and not over the learning process, as I already understood most concepts provided in the modules.</p>

<h2 id="themes">Themes</h2>
<p>The theme that I am currently using is Minimal, it provides the header on the left side of the screen, while having the main content provided on the right. The main problem I had with this theme however, was the lack of a dark mode option.</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>I looked for a Minimal Dark theme and I did come across many Github Projects to create such a theme, however many either had many dependancy issues or had simply been removed. Essentially what this meant was I needed to make CSS tweaks by myself.</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>To start off, I wanted to accomplish a dark theme with a matching colors. So for me, I chose a black background, Cyan titles, and white text. I implemented this through the use of style tags. From there on out, I made CSS look the same on each page, with the same idea.</p>

<h2 id="preloading-screen-and-typing-effect">Preloading Screen and Typing Effect</h2>

<p>The Preloading Screen I followed several Stack Overflow Discussions, along with a website to make it. The following links are below:</p>

<p>https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4571423/how-to-preload-a-webpage-before-showing-it</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>Following these website, I was able to establish a cool looking preloading page</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>Along with the preloading page, I wanted to implement a Typing Effect, which again I followed a website tutorial for:
